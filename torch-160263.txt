Title: Graph partition + Fake Dependency from view op\n\nBody (truncated):
Repro: `PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_INDUCTOR=1 python test/test_torch.py 
TestTorchDeviceTypeCUDA.test_addcmul_use_cpu_scalar_True_cuda_complex64` with 
mode=reduce-overhead and graph partition on. 
To repro, we should also turn off `maybe_reorder_for_minimizing_partition` and 
`reorder_for_partition_with_simple_dependency` which reorders to only 1 graph partition.\n
\n
Error:\n
`UnboundLocalError: local variable 'buf3' referenced before assignment`\n\nAnalysis:\nIn partition_0, `buf3` is viewed as `buf4`, which is viewed as `buf5`, and finally return `buf5` as an output. 
Due to fake dependency from `buf5` to `buf3`, `buf3` is not deallocated in partition_0. 
Since `buf3` is not directly used in partition_1, partition_1 also does not take it as an input.\n\nLater, when `buf5` gets deallocated, `buf3` is not used anymore and is also deallocated immediately. 
HOWEVER, `buf3` is not an input to partition_1, which leads to the error.\n
